## Pivot

How to create/populate Pivots with Templater

### Leaning on Excel features

Templater doesn't support creating pivot from scratch, but if Pivot is defined and it uses some data source,
then Templater can be used to populate that data source which results in pivot allowing data analysis.

If Refresh data on file open setting is checked, Excel will recalculate pivot as expected.

If you hide DataSource sheet, it will look like only Pivot exists (note that this work correctly only on licensed version)
