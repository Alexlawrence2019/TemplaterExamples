Simple application combining various Templater features.

Templater is useful when you need to create pretty documents since it will allow you to prepare template in Word and Excel.
This way pretty documents are not programmed, but only populated with data.

In Excel, tables are combined to produce a non-trivial result. Newer version of Templater would work with such template even in tables were not used, but just plain cells.

In Word, ordered list is used to present information in visually good looking way. Also, built-in keyword join is used to concatenate collection of strings into a single row. With Templater 2 custom keywords can be added too (or default ones can be overridden).
